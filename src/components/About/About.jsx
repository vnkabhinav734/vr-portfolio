            <p className='body'>Hi there! ðŸ‘‹ I'm a passionate full stack developer and automation tester with a love for crafting cutting-edge applications. 
            My journey into the world of software development began with a fascination for Java, and since then, I've expanded my toolkit to include React, Angular, and Node.js. I am now actively working with technologies like Selenium, 
            Web driver and BDD Cucumber to develop testing frameworks which has helped develop a test and behaviour driven approach.
            With over 2 years of industry experience under my belt as a Full Stack Developer and Automation tester, I've had the opportunity to work on diverse projects, honing my skills and pushing boundaries. 
            I thrive in dynamic environments where innovation and creativity are encouraged. 
            I'm always eager to delve into new technologies and techniques, constantly seeking to broaden my knowledge and expertise. 
            Whether it's diving into the latest framework or mastering a new programming language, I embrace the challenge with enthusiasm and determination. Collaboration is at the heart of what I do, and I'm excited about the possibility of working together on projects or exploring full-time opportunities. 
            Let's join forces and create some truly awesome stuff! Feel free to reach outâ€”I'm ready to embark on the next adventure in the world of software development and testing.
